You will write the loop to perform 1000 epochs.\n","- **Model B**: using the Sequential class of pytorch\n","- **Model C**: a custom torch.nn.Module class for this.\n","\n","For Model B and C, you will use the ready made loss and optimization from the nn and optim packages. You can use the same code to optimize the parameters of Model B and C.\n","\n","### Loss\n","\n","Since we are dealing with a binary classification problem, we will use a Binary Cross Entropy loss (use ```torch.nn.BCELoss``` for Model B and C).\n","\n","### Parameters update/ Optimization\n","\n","For updating the parameters, we will use as optimizer a simple SGD algorithm (use ```torch.optim.SGD``` for Model B and C) with a learning rate of 0.1.\n","\n","Don't forget that an optimizer is applied to a set of parameters (```my_model.parameters()``` gives the parameters of the network for Model B and C).\n","Once the gradients have been computed (after the backpropagation has been performed), you can perform one step of optimization (using ```optimizer.step()``` for Model B and C).\n","\n","### Backward propagation\n","\n","Backpropagation is automatically performed in pytorch using the ```autograd``` package. \n","First, reset the gradients of all parameters (using ```optimizer.zero_grad()``` for Model B and C), then perform the backpropagation ```loss.backward()```. \n","\n","## Your task:\n","\n","You need to add the missing parts in the code (parts between ```# --- START CODE HERE``` and ```# --- END CODE HERE```)\n","\n","## Documentation:\n","- NN: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html\n","- Autograd: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html\n","- Optim: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tuvU8y2Lo60Z"},"source":["## Load the python packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"I1VTuwVio60a"},"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","from torch.autograd import Variable\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","student = True"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Zof__thjo60d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"91c98588-5328-4b0b-f61d-c354c3ccac94"},"source":["print(torch.__version__)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1.6.0+cu101\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Bsb-phrJo60g"},"source":["## Dataset\n","\n","We take the usual circle dataset from sklearn."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Otam7ukPo60g"},"source":["from sklearn import datasets\n","X_np, y_np = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=1000, noise=0.2, factor=0.5)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-5idAV4Co60i"},"source":["We convert the ```numpy tensors``` to ```torch tensors```. \n","The difference being that the latters allows to do automatic gradient differentiation (back-propagation)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rPxnzVSDo60j"},"source":["X = torch.from_numpy(X_np).float()\n","y = torch.from_numpy(y_np).float()\n","y = y.view(len(y), 1)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YHgd8JYPo60l","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85},"outputId":"4878e272-7680-4c58-c711-bed2e86d4748"},"source":["print(X.size())\n","print(y.size())\n","print(X.mean(dim=0))\n","print(X.std(dim=0))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["torch.Size([1000, 2])\n","torch.Size([1000, 1])\n","tensor([0.0042, 0.0023])\n","tensor([0.5999, 0.5880])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Unp-3kjjo60n"},"source":["## Normalization"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6rIwFaauo60n","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51},"outputId":"151f415e-d0a5-47b1-bc4a-40fb9b1817dc"},"source":["X -= X.mean(dim=0)\n","X /= X.std(dim=0)\n","print(X.mean(dim=0))\n","print(X.std(dim=0))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([ 1.9342e-08, -1.0118e-08])\n","tensor([1., 1.])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Rc3VgVWOo60p"},"source":["## Definition of the hyper-parameters"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OrBQMqCJo60r"},"source":["n_in = X.shape[1]\n","n_h1 = 20\n","n_h2 = 10\n","n_out = 1\n","\n","nb_epoch = 10000\n","alpha = 0.1"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CIzjntgZo60t"},"source":["## Model 1 (writing the network equations)\n","\n","Here, you will define the variables and write the equations of the network yourself (as you would do in numpy).\n","However you will use ```torch tensors``` instead of ```numpy array```. \n","\n","***Why ?*** because torch tensors will allows you to automatically get the gradient.
